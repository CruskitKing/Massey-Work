	<header>What we pay attention to is important</header>
	<content>Like when we pay attention to negative stuff with our thoughts (remember Realistic Thinking) and end up feeling bad.
	
	Like - say you were nervous about going to camp. You COULD just notice your clammy hands, your nervous tummy, listen to others saying they don't want to go in case it's awful, keep looking at the camp letter describing activities you don't know anything abut - and JUST KEEP WORRYING!
	
	Or, you could listen to others talk about the fun they had at camp, ask them about the food and think about that AND FEEL BETTER.
		
		
	What do you notice right now? Sounds? Sights? Sensations? Inside the room? Outside the room?
		
	When you notice yourself having negative thoughts, take your thoughts to notice what sounds and sights there are around you.
